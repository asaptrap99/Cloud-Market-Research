# Report

The fact that the cloud infrastructure market enjoyed another exceptional quarter is not breaking news. Following the prominent three vendors' earnings reports this week, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, who together captured 65% of worldwide cloud computing spending in Q1 2022, surpassed their competition to the point where their combined dominance limits competitors from pursuing specialized markePts.

If you're anything like me, you might be curious about the regional market size for each platform as wells.


## But what about the regions?

Although the regional market study is heavily understudied and speculative, we still conducted exhaustive research that led to fascinating insights about many regional market cap. 
We essentially utilized multiple prominent features, which will allow us to develop a stochastic model which inturn helps us to predict the market cap for various regions of the top three cloud vendors. We presented our findings via interactive visualization shown below. 


## Let's Dive deep


Both AWS and Azure are seeing an increase in income from year to year. Compared to the same quarter the year before, AWS and Azure earnings have increased in a given quarter. Because not all businesses provide a detailed revenue breakdown, it is tricky to compare their cloud revenue like-for-like. However, Azure had the highest year-over-year (YoY) cloud revenue growth in Q4 2021, at 50%. Google Cloud came in second place with a 45 percent share, and AWS came in third with a 32 percent YoY revenue increase. Although Azure continues to close the gap in many locations, it is almost probable that AWS will maintain the top spot in terms of overall revenue this quarter.
